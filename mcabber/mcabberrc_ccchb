# create these messages with the 'event_log_dir' variable (default is the
# system temp dir, or MCABBERTMPDIR environment variable).  Please note
# that mcabber won't delete these files, it's your script's job.
#

#   $events_command MSG IN jabber@id [file] (when receiving a message)

# mcabber can create a FIFO named pipe and listen to this pipe for commands.
# Default: disabled.

# in the log window (they will still be written to the tracelog file).
